## Getting started with Project

As we get the list of team members and Figma designs we first decided to study the Figma Designs so that we can make exact UI/UX. Then we distributed the work among our teammates and started working on Web-app, For this, we have used GitHub it made our work easier.
Team-Work
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.
That is true this project has taught us the importance of working in a team. Collaboration within a group can help solve difficult problems. Brainstorming is a good opportunity for the team to exchange ideas and come up with creative ways of doing things. By working together, teams can find the solutions that work best.
Before starting the project, I was unclear and had a lot of doubts related to the development of the project. Here are some of the big ones:
The key points to focus on.
Implementation of the flow of the functionalities.
Manage the Github repository while collaborating with the team members.
Division of the tasks amongst the team members considering their respective strengths.

But, all the challenges and questions were answered along the initial analysis process where we brainstormed on the various aspects of the project.
